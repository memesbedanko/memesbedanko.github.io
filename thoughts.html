					<h1 class="content-header">Texas COVID mandates</h1>

					<p class="content-para">TLDR: Texas has lifted COVID mandates, but that doesn't mean ignore how other parties react or ignore the consequences of forgoing the mandates.</p>
					<p class="content-para">"Texans have mastered the daily habits to avoid getting covid." </p>
					<p class="content-para">Words spoken by Texas governor Greg Abbott. Look, I am all for natural selection and for those not willing to be safe to forfeit their right of health and prosperity. If you do not want to wear a seat belt, you forfeit your safety by having the possibility of flying through the windshield. In the same vain- if you do not want to wear a mask, fine don't, but if a business tells you to leave due to your lack of a mask, or a mother tells you to wash your hands before touching her baby, you have to be ready for the consequences of rejecting their wishes. Just because you chose not to follow a safer route, not only for yourself but the others around you, doesn't mean others have to abide by your unsafe justification.  </p>

					<p class="content-para">Lifting the mandates also poses another problem. Perhaps there will be increased positivity rates and more cases because of the lifts. Besides putting a possible strain on hospitals, or seeing an up-tick in deaths, this poses a problem for others who wish to continue following the mandates. Those who wish to stay safe, i.e. keep wearing their seatbelt, now have to deal with the increased risk of a now open state, and many people at ease for following the government. While this could all be speculation, and I hope it is, the risk are still there and only time will tell what this action by the Texas government does. </p>

					<p class="content-para">What matters in the end is safety, not pride or principles. If you do not wish to follow the mandates, then don't. That is your prerogative, but you need to also remember that other people and Texas as a whole will react to your choice. Ending up in a COVID rage video, hospital, dead, or with the guilt of possibly killing someone else is not worth your pride or principles. Follow the mandates or don't, but remember your actions have consequences </p>

					<h1 class="content-header">Domestic Terrorism: Colorado, Georgia </h1>
					<p class="content-para"> In the last week, two terrorist attacks happened. These were domestic terrorists who armed with guns, gunned down 10 and 8 people respectively. I was always a strong advocate that banning guns wouldn't do anything as if someone wanted to hurt someone, there are other ways to do so.  If we look at history, we can see banning alcohol lead to an underground market, banning media will lead to illegal ways of obtaining it, and banning guns out right will lead to the same issues. Even if we look at other countries like England where gun laws are strict, people have found other ways to commit terror. Acid throwing, stabbings, and car homicide. <br>
					But now, we are at a point in time where shootings are not if, but when. As an American, it is not surprising to see a shooting in the news. What is surprising is the lack of progress in resolving this issue. Due to a piece of paper written over 200 years ago, Americans now are so self-righteous to the apparent right to own guns. So they can have the freedom to purchase a firearm while the town 30 minutes away gets gunned down? Regardless of the 'rights' being stripped from us I thought it was American, or even human to care about our fellow man. Obviously, this is not the case. Those public servants we elect would rather stay true to their ways and die on this hill. Gunned down by 9mm and Ar-15s. <br>
					We are at the point in America where we cannot sit around while we look for a solution to our problem, we need to deal with the symptoms here and now. Instead of allowing firearms and letting 'those people' be happy with this notion, firearms, for better or worse need to be restricted or dare I say, banned. I for one am tired of looking for the problem leading to terrorism, we need to deal with the symptom and its aftermath. We need to deal with the thing bringing terror to schools, shopping centers, groceries or churches and that is allowing terrorist, and therefore the public the ability to own firearms.

					<h1 class="content-header">The state of content </h1>
					<p class="content-para"> Over the past decade, the online content we consume has changed drastically. From silly homemade videos, tutorials, skits, letsplays, and everything in between, content has always been evolving. With that evolution taste, formats, and creators have risen and fallen. Once upon a time, youtube was just a place for video to be shared. No one considered making a living off it. Nowadays this is the reality we live in and for the better. That incentive creates some of the best content imaginable, however that incentive also has drawbacks as-well. <br> 
					When word got around that the a living could be made on youtube, a formula was developed early. Ten minute videos, mid-roll ads, and consistent uploads. Seems reasonable as you can have constant viewer-ship, multiple eyes on said ads, and new people perhaps being reeled in by new content. This all changed when the dreaded "adpocalypses" happened. Less money from ads, tighter restrictions on what can be advertised-leading to demonitization on videos, and less advertisers over all as some companies do not want to be associated with any negative press that some creators can attract. Where does this leave creators in the current space? Well in 2021 the way people earn living on youtube are constant uploads, PG content, bright-fun-silly thumbnails, and overall safe content.
