					<h1 class="content-header">Texas COVID mandates</h1>

					<p class="content-para">TLDR: Texas has lifted COVID mandates, but that doesn't mean ignore how other parties react or ignore the consequences of forgoing the mandates.</p>
					<p class="content-para">"Texans have mastered the daily habits to avoid getting covid." </p>
					<p class="content-para">Words spoken by Texas governor Greg Abbott. Look, I am all for natural selection and for those not willing to be safe to forfeit their right of health and prosperity. If you do not want to wear a seat belt, you forfeit your safety by having the possibility of flying through the windshield. In the same vain- if you do not want to wear a mask, fine don't, but if a business tells you to leave due to your lack of a mask, or a mother tells you to wash your hands before touching her baby, you have to be ready for the consequences of rejecting their wishes. Just because you chose not to follow a safer route, not only for yourself but the others around you, doesn't mean others have to abide by your unsafe justification.  </p>

					<p class="content-para">Lifting the mandates also poses another problem. Perhaps there will be increased positivity rates and more cases because of the lifts. Besides putting a possible strain on hospitals, or seeing an up-tick in deaths, this poses a problem for others who wish to continue following the mandates. Those who wish to stay safe, i.e. keep wearing their seatbelt, now have to deal with the increased risk of a now open state, and many people at ease for following the government. While this could all be speculation, and I hope it is, the risk are still there and only time will tell what this action by the Texas government does. </p>

					<p class="content-para">What matters in the end is safety, not pride or principles. If you do not wish to follow the mandates, then don't. That is your prerogative, but you need to also remember that other people and Texas as a whole will react to your choice. Ending up in a COVID rage video, hospital, dead, or with the guilt of possibly killing someone else is not worth your pride or principles. Follow the mandates or don't, but remember your actions have consequences </p>
